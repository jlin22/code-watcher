# code-watcher
## What is this?
Code watcher is a basic stopwatch program that you can tell to start the time and end the time and it will store the data for you. I created this, because I wanted to track how much time I spent on coding or any other hobby I wanted to improve at
## Requirements
Have python3 installed
## How do you use this?
To start the stopwatch run:
`python3 stopwatch.py -b`
To end the stopwatch and log the data, run:
`python3 stopwatch.py -e`
